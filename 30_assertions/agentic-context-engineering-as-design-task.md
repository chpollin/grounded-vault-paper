# Context engineering treats the assembly of the model context as an engineering task with its own criterion

## Statement

Under the practice term context engineering, the assembly of what reaches the model is handled as work with a stated goal. The term is defined as the set of strategies for curating and maintaining the optimal set of tokens during inference, counting the information that lands in the context outside the prompts, and the criterion of doing it well is stated as the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximises the likelihood of some desired outcome. The curation phase recurs each time something is passed to the model, so the assembly is a repeated decision under that criterion. Experiments that vary the input context size and the position of the relevant information within it supply the empirical subject matter of such a decision, because model performance can degrade significantly when the position of the relevant information within the input context changes, with performance often highest when that information stands at the beginning or the end, and because a longer input context trades the added information against the added content the model must reason over.

- [[20_distillates/publications/anthropic-2025-context-engineering#^s4]] — gives the temporal shape, a curation phase recurring at every handover to the model
- [[20_distillates/publications/anthropic-2025-context-engineering#^s6]] — states the optimisation criterion, the smallest set of high-signal tokens for the desired outcome
- [[20_distillates/documents/liu-2024-lost-in-the-middle#^s1]] — reports the measured dependence of performance on the position of the relevant information
- [[20_distillates/documents/liu-2024-lost-in-the-middle#^s2]] — carries the experimental variation of context size and position
- [[20_distillates/documents/liu-2024-lost-in-the-middle#^s17]] — states the trade-off that more context brings more content to reason over
